# Gatsby Starter
Starter boilerplate for Gatsby websites.

## Technologies
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [ESM](https://github.com/standard-things/esm)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

### JavaScript
JavaScript is listed using ESLint. The standard is [eslint-config-wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos).

### Styles
Styles are handled via Styled Components. Normalize.css is imported into the Layout component. There are modifications to many CSS attributes in the Layout component. Styles are listed via Stylelint and Prettier. Stylelint is modified to lint styled-components. One of the most important rules to me that's included is ordering CSS attributes alphabetically.
